# Christ Convent Church System
Christ Convent Church System is a web-based application designed to facilitate member management for Christ Convent Church, a church located in the US. This project was undertaken during my 2nd year long holiday as a freelance project. The system allows for easy management of church members and their associated information, such as personal details, family relationships, and contact information. It provides features for adding new members, editing member information, and searching for members within the system.

## Features
Add new members to the system with their personal details
Establish family relationships between members, such as parent-child relationships
Display all members in an organized manner
Edit member information, including personal details and family relationships
Search for members based on various criteria, such as name or contact information
